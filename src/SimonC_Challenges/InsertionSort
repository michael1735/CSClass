Insertion sort
Another sorting algorithm is an insertion sort.

Here, we view the array as two lists; one sorted and the other unsorted. At the beginning, the sorted list is empty, and the unsorted list contains all the elements.

The algorithm will then take items from the unsorted list, in sequence, and 'insert' them into the correct position in the sorted list.

To insert an element, the algorithm compares it with the elements in the sorted subarray, moving larger elements up one position to make space for the new element. The algorithm continues until the entire array is sorted.

Expected Input

A series of integers, to be added to the array
In the range of 1-100
Code in the program will add the values to the array
e.g.
3
4
5
6
1
9
10
22
8
23

Expected Output

The original array
The next item to be inserted into the sorted list
A message for everytime the new item is smaller/bigger than an item already in the list
The sorted array
e.g.
Original
[ 3 4 5 6 1 9 10 22 8 23 ]

Item to insert = 4
Bigger than 3
Item to insert = 5
Bigger than 4
Item to insert = 6
Bigger than 5
Item to insert = 1
Smaller than 6
Smaller than 5
Smaller than 4
Smaller than 3
Smallest item
Item to insert = 9
Bigger than 6
Item to insert = 10
Bigger than 9
Item to insert = 22
Bigger than 10
Item to insert = 8
Smaller than 22
Smaller than 10
Smaller than 9
Bigger than 6
Item to insert = 23
Bigger than 22

Sorted
[ 1 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 22 23 ]
