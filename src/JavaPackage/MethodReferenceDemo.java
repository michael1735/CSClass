    You use lambda expressions to create anonymous methods. Sometimes, however, a lambda expression does nothing
    but call an existing method. In those cases, it's often clearer to refer to the existing method
    by name. Method References enable you to do this; they are compact, easy-to-read lambda expressions for methods
    that already have a name.
