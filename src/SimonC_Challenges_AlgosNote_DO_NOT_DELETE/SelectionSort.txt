Selection sort
A selection sort finds the smallest item in the array and puts it at the front of the array.

Here are the steps for selection sort:

Set the first index of the unsorted section to the first index of the array.
Find the minimum value in the unsorted section of the array.
Swap the minimum value with the first element of the unsorted section.
Increment the index of the first element of the unsorted section.
Repeat steps 2-4 until the unsorted section has been completely traversed.
